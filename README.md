# waterline-mongo-objectid-comparison-funk

This repository highlights what appears to be an issue preventing Waterline's `sails-mongo` adapter from converting inputs to Mongo `ObjectId` instances in appropriate contexts when paired with certain comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).

For instance, given the following model:

```js
/**
 * @file Post.js
 */

module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    content: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      maxLength: 280,
      minLength: 1,
    },
  },
};
```

And a dataset like so:

| _id                                    | content      | createdAt     | updatedAt     |
|----------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| `ObjectId("5e9a49923a48025cccdaee43")` | Hello World! | 1587169682656 | 1587169682656 |
| `ObjectId("5e9a49923a48025cccdaee44")` | Testing 123. | 1587169682656 | 1587169682656 |
| `ObjectId("5e9a49923a48025cccdaee45")` | Testing 456. | 1587169682656 | 1587169682656 |
| `ObjectId("5e9a49923a48025cccdaee46")` | Testing 789. | 1587169682656 | 1587169682656 |

The following query will not return results as expected:

```js
// Try and find the next item after our input.
Post.find({
  id: {
    '>': '5e9a49923a48025cccdaee43',
  },
}).sort('id ASC').limit(1).then((res) => {
  // Logs "Found []"
  sails.log.debug('Found', res);
});
```

The expected result of this query is to return the item directly after our input ID, if any:

```js
[{
  id: '5e9a49923a48025cccdaee44',
  createdAt: 1587169682656,
  updatedAt: 1587169682656,
  content: 'Testing 123.'
}]
```

We instead receive only an empty array, regardless of whether a match exists or not:

```js
[]
```

This is a result of `sails-mongo` passing the ID value to Mongo directly as a string rather than normalising it to an `ObjectId` as is done with other query operations.

The following operations work as expected and convert appropriate inputs to `ObjectId`:
  - equality
  - `!=`
  - `nin`
  - `in`

The following operations do not work as expected, and leave the input unmodified:
  - `<`
  - `<=`
  - `>`
  - `>=`

Queries like the one shown above can provide a nice, hassle-free method of paging through long lists. Additionally, document IDs can serve as a nice tie-breaker when paging on fields that might not necessarily be unique (such as `createdAt`).

Without being able to rely on the document ID as a tie-breaker, pagination can become unnecessarily complicated, or if done naÃ¯vely, may be prone to skipping records in some scenarios.

Furthermore, this behaviour does not appear to be consistent with that of the `sails-postgresql` adapter, which functions as expected when using the comparison operators affected with `sails-mongo`.

## Testing

This issue can be demonstrated by simply running `node queryTest`, which should detect whether or not queries work as expected using document IDs and display one of the following messages before exiting:

> `Query test has succeeded!`

 - Emit when the test has determined that queries involving document IDs work as expected.

> `Query test has failed: ...`

 - Emit when the test has determined that queries do not allow comparisons with document IDs as expected.

> `Failed to load Sails app: ...`

  - Emit when something has prevented Sails from loading; most likely a configuration issue.
  - One should ensure that [datastore configuration](./config/datastore.js) has been properly setup.

Please note that this is only a cursory test which examines a single affected operator and should not be used to test overall correctness or conformance.

## Resolution

A super simple fix for this can be found in the [fpm-git/sails-mongo](https://github.com/fpm-git/sails-mongo/tree/bug/fix-mongo-oid-comparison-normalisation) fork. This of course comes with no warranties, though has been tested to work great for our use case.
